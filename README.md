## Introduction

Customer churn, or customer attrition, is a critical concern for businesses. Predicting which customers are likely to churn can help companies take proactive measures to retain customers. In this project, we use an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to create a predictive model for customer churn.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available in the `data` directory. It includes features such as customer demographics, usage patterns, and historical data to train the model. Make sure to review the dataset and preprocess it according to your specific requirements.

## Installation

To set up the environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-ann.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd customer-churn-ann
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Preprocess the Data:** Before training the model, preprocess the dataset using the provided preprocessing script:

   ```bash
   python preprocess_data.py
   ```

2. **Train the Model:** Train the ANN model by running the following command:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. **Make Predictions:** Use the trained model to make predictions on new data:

   ```bash
   python predict.py --input_path path/to/new_data.csv
   ```

## Model Architecture

The ANN model architecture is defined in the `model.py` file. Customize the architecture as needed for your specific use case.

## Training

Adjust the hyperparameters and training settings in the `config.yaml` file. Run the training script to train the model on your preprocessed data.

```bash
python train_model.py
```

## Evaluation

Evaluate the model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The evaluation script is available in `evaluate_model.py`.

```bash
python evaluate_model.py
```
